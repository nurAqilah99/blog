</header></center>
<article>
    <h1 style="font-size:160%;">UV Rays Are the Most Significant Threat to Skin</h1>
	<p style="font-size:120%;">First up: the sun. “UV radiation is the most significant environmental
		factor and also one of the most recognized when it comes to skin damage
		and aging,” says Marisa Garshick, MD, a dermatologist at Medical
		Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery in New York City.<br><br>
		UV rays trigger the production of free radicals in the skin that lead to DNA
		damage and the breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin, causing
		wrinkles, notes the World Health Organization (WHO); it also stimulates
		the melanin production that leads to skin discolorations, says Garshick.<br><br>
		According to a 2017 article in Tropical Dermatology, melanin is a pigment
		that gives skin its color. Beyond aesthetics is the increased risk of skin
		cancers. It’s the cumulative effect of sun exposure that, over time, can
		lead to the formation of non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell
		carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); early childhood UV
		exposure may be a bigger factor in melanoma skin cancers, which can be
		deadly, the WHO points out.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Air Pollution Plays a Role in Accelerating Skin Aging</h1>
	<p style="font-size:120%;">Air pollution doesn’t just affect how you breathe. As the U.S.
		Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warns, it can also create the same
		free radical damage in skin as light. “Exposure to air pollution, which
		includes particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons, and ozone,
		creates oxidative damage in the skin that increases inflammation,” says
		Dr. Chwalek, whose statement is supported by data cited in a review
		published in Dermato-Endocrinology.<br><br>
		Consider particulate matter (PM), for instance. PM is a mixture of small
		particles and liquid droplets, such as organic chemicals and soil or dust,
		according to the EPA. A study on human skin cell cultures published in
		September 2018 in the International Journal of Molecular
		Sciences suggests that PM stimulates skin inflammation and impairs
		collagen synthesis.<br><br>
		Over time, this may cause sagging and fine lines and wrinkles. “Pollution
		creates the free radicals in skin that prematurely chew up collagen and
		elastin,” says Rebecca Kazin, MD, an associate director at the Washington
		Institute of Dermatological Laser Surgery in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
		What’s more, if you’re dealing with dark spots appearing on your face,
		you may have cars to blame. An article published in May 2016 in
		the Journal of Investigative Dermatology also shows that exposure to air
		particles from traffic is linked to pigment spots on cheeks, Garshick points
		out.</P>

<br>
<br>
	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">The Sun Isn’t the Only Skin Scourge</h1>
	<p style="font-size:120%;">Blue light or visible light is one potential skin ager that experts are
		increasingly wary of. “Blue light lies on the visible light spectrum. It is
		high-energy wavelength light that comes from our computer screens and
		phones,” says Garshick. While research is still emerging and studies tend
		to be very small, some suggest that keeping your face stuck in a screen
		all day could also lead to premature aging.<br> <br>
		For example, one study published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular
		Longevity in February 2015 suggested that visible light increased free
		radical formation in the skin. Another, in the December 2018 issue of
		the Journal of Biomedical Physics Engineering suggests that this freeradical-generating light also includes the flash on smartphones. (The title
		even asks if taking selfies can lead to premature aging.)</p>
