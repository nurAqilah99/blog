    <h1 style="font-size:160%;">Beta Carotene Helps Protects Against Sun Damage</h1>
	<img src="carrot.jpg" alt="Skin treat"width="500"  ></a>
	<h4 id = "story1"     </h4>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">Red, orange, and yellow fruits and veggies, like carrots, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins, are packed with beta carotene, a nutrient with many benefits for your skin, says Ido Leffler,cofounder of the Yes To skin-care line. Your body converts beta carotene into vitamin A, an
		essential nutrient for healing wounds, protecting against sun damage, and encouraging cell
		turnover.</P>
	<p style="font-size:120%;">"Topical beta carotene has antioxidant benefits on the skin, and research has reported that it
		improves discoloration due to melasma," says Jessica Wu, MD, assistant clinical professor of
		dermatology at University of Southern California in Los Angeles and author of Feed Your
		Face: Younger, Smoother Skin and a Beautiful Body in 28 Delicious Days.
		You can find it in Burt's Bees Complete Nourishment Facial Oil ($15.19) and Yes to Carrots
		Daily Facial Moisture with SPF 15 ($8).

    <h1 style="font-size:160%;">Green Tea Extract Is an Excellent AntiInflammatory for Skin</h1>
	<img src="greentea.jpg" alt="Skin treat"width="500" height="400" ></a>
	<h4 id = "story2"  </h4>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">This healthy drink contains high levels of antioxidant chemicals — including catechins, such
		as epigallocatechin gallate, and flavonoids, such as kaempferol and theaflavin — to help
		prevent and reverse UV damage to the skin, explains Neal Schultz, MD, a dermatologist in
		New York City and creator of BeautyRx Skincare. These same chemicals make green tea an
		excellent natural anti-inflammatory and skin soothing ingredient in skin care.</p>

<br>
  <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Licorice Extract Helps Treat Redness and Rosacea</h1>
	<img src="licorine.jpg" alt="Skin treat"width="500" height="400"></a>
	<h4 id = "story3"  </h4>
	<P style="font-size:120%;">The anti-inflammatory properties of licorice extract make this one of the best natural
		ingredients to treat redness and rosacea. And the plant has also been shown to reduce uneven
		pigmentation by blocking the production of melanin. Dr. Wu suggests looking for licorice
		extract in eye treatments because one study found that a cream containing the ingredient
		helped lighten dark under eye circles.</p>
	


<br>
  <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Oats Soothe Eczema and Other Skin Irritation</h1>
	<img src="oat.jpg" alt="Skin treat" width="500" height="400" ></a>
	<h4 id = "story4"  </h4>
	<P style="font-size:120%;">Colloidal oatmeal is one of the few natural ingredients that the Food and Drug
		Administration (FDA) has approved to treat skin irritations, such as eczema, dry skin, poison
		ivy, poison oak, and insect bites, says Wu. "Oat lipids and proteins help replenish and
		maintain the skin barrier," she explains, "and oats contain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
		chemicals."</p>

	

<br>
  <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Soy Helps Brighten Dull Skin and Is a GoodAlternative to Stronger Prescription Products</h1>
	<img src="nut.jpg" alt="Skin treat"width="500" height="400"></a>
	<h4 id = "story5"  </h4>
	<P style="font-size:120%;">"Look for this ingredient if you'd like your skin to look brighter and more even-toned," Wu
		says. "Topical soy has been shown to lighten discoloration due to melasma and sun damage
		by inhibiting skin's overproduction of melanin skin pigment."
		Soy-based products are a particularly good option for those looking for an alternative to
		prescription-strength ingredients, like retinoids and hydroquinone </p>
	
  
<br>
  <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Vitamin C Helps Battle Aging and Sagging Skin</h1>
	<img src="vitamin.jpg" alt="Skin treat" width="500" height="400"></a>
	<h4 id = "story6"  </h4>
	<P style="font-size:120%;">You may think of vitamin C as an essential defense against the common cold, but the nutrient
		also battles the common signs of aging skin: sagging and dullness. Vitamin C aids in collagen
		synthesis, which is essential for firmness and smoothness, Wu explains. Plus, it has
		antioxidant benefits to help fight free-radical damage, and lightens dark spots. As if this little
		vitamin didn't already work hard enough, C can also regulate sebum production to prevent
		acne and decrease inflammation.</p>
	

<br>
	<br>
		<h1 style="font-size:160%;">Willow Herb Has Anti-Microbial and Antiseptic
		Properties</h1>
		<img src="willowherb.jpg" alt="Skin treat" width="500" height="400"></a>
			<h4 id = "story7"  </h4>
			<P style="font-size:120%;">Willow herb, a wildflower, is a unique anti-microbial, anti-irritant, and natural antiseptic that
				has long been used to sooth common skin irritations, including rosacea and eczema.
				One of the little flower's benefits includes the ability to kill Propionibacterium
				acnes bacteria, the nasty microbes that cause acne, which makes the natural ingredient a great
				option for treating breakouts, says Paula Begoun, founder of the skin care and cosmetics
				brand Paula’s Choice	</p>
		
<br>
	<br>
		  <h1 style="font-size:160%;">Witch Hazel Helps Control Oil, but Hydrates, Too</h1>
		  <img src="witchazel.jpg" alt="Skin treat" width="500" height="400"></a>
			<h4 id = "story8"  </h4>
			<P style="font-size:120%;">Witch hazel has been a staple home remedy for centuries, says Renée Rouleau, a celebrity
				esthetician. She explains that witch hazel is an excellent ingredient in toners and moisturizers
				to control oil while also offering hydration and reducing redness.
				"Witch hazel can be used on sores, bruises, and swelling," says Dr. Schultz. That's why you'll
				often see the ingredient in aftershaves, he says. Rouleau offers this note of caution: "The
				witch hazel astringent found in drugstores usually contains alcohol and is not recommended
				as it will strip your skin of moisture."</p></center>
