    <h1 style="font-size:160%; width:800px">1. If You’re Acne-Prone, Sop Up Oil With a Clay Mask</h1>
	
	
    <p style="font-size:120%; width:800px">When you battle breakouts on the regular, you’re always looking for the
			next great thing to help clear your skin. In reality, a mask is only going to
			do so much. “It’s important to find a daily regimen to keep acne under
			control, [rather than rely solely] on a weekly mask,” says Dr. Waldorf. <br> <br>
			Still, using a clay-based mask — she likes Caudalie’s Purifying Mask —
			“can help make skin look and feel better,” she says. Waldorf points to its
			ingredients like sage, which helps fight inflammation, according to past
			research; zinc, which a review published in July 2014 in Dermatology<br> <br>
			Research and Practice showed can fight bacteria; and of course clay,
			which an earlier study showed can help purge impurities from pores by 
			making you sweat. These ingredients work together to banish breakouts
			at the source.

    <h1 style="font-size:160%; width:800px">2. If Your Skin Needs a Boost of Brightness, Go for a Gentle
Exfoliant
</h1>
	
	
    <p style="font-size:120%;width:800px">When dead cells on your skin’s outer layer build up, you may notice that
			your complexion looks dull. If you have pigmentation problems or acne
			that includes blackheads or whiteheads, you may additionally benefit from
			exfoliation, which sloughs off these old cells and reveals newer, brighterlooking cells underneath, according to the American Academy of
			Dermatology (AAD). “I typically like masks that balance moisturization
			alongside an active ingredient that’s a mild exfoliant or an alpha hydroxy
			acid (AHA),” says Dr. Hollmig.<br> <br>
			If you’re not familiar, AHAs are a class of chemical compounds that
			includes glycolic and lactic acid, per CosmeticsInfo.org. (These differ from
			beta hydroxy acids, or BHAs, the most famous of which is anti-acne
			salicylic acid.) Because some people find that the process of exfoliation
			can be irritating, meaning it causes your skin to burn or become red, you
			can counter that potential reaction with a good moisturizer. <br><br>
			Glow Recipe Watermelon and AHA Glow Sleeping Mask is one example. It
			supplies AHAs (thanks to lactic and glycolic acids, a study noted) to
			remove dead cells and even tone, plus hyaluronic acid for moisturizing, as
			a study published in May 2016 in the German journal MMW Advances
			Med found. Another tip to counteract possible irritation, says Hollmig, is 
			to use an AHA mask weekly or a couple of times per week before using it daily.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;width:800px">3. To Address Hyperpigmentation, Look for Specific Botanicals</h1>
	
	
	<P style="font-size:120%;width:800px">Discoloration can be from a pimple that left a red mark behind or the
			result of too much sun exposure that led to dark spots, according to the
			AAD. Treating your skin means interrupting the pigmentation process,
			from stopping cells from pumping out melanin (the pigment in your skin)<br><br>
			to breaking it down at its surface. Along with adequate sun protection (to
			stop darkness from worsening), there are several plant-based ingredients
			that work as lighteners. Mario Badescu’s Whitening Mask contains kojic
			acid, mulberry, and licorice root. Research published in the Journal of
			Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery showed that all three of these
			ingredients show promise in attacking pigment by inhibiting melanin
			production, reducing inflammation, and providing antioxidant properties.</p>
	


<br>
  <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;width:800px">4. If You Have Sensitive Skin, Try One With Skin Soothers</h1>
	
	
	<P style="font-size:120%; width:800px">When your skin reacts easily and erupts in redness, stinging, burning, or
			itching in response to environmental factors (from heat to sun to topical
			products), it may be sensitive, noted a study published in March 2016
			in Acta Dermato-Venerologica. As such, it can be tough to find something
			compatible with your complexion.<br><br> Waldorf recommends going for a mask 
			that’s moisturizing only. It’s also helpful to look for one that’s
			hypoallergenic, which means it’s less likely to trigger irritation.
			Avène Soothing Sheet Mask is alcohol- and fragrance-free, has a short list
			of ingredients (so there’s less of a chance something is in there to cause a
			reaction), and it calms with thermal spring water. In a past review,
			researchers noted that this water, which naturally contains trace
			minerals, acts as an anti-inflammatory and reduces the immune response
			that triggers symptoms.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;width:800px">5. If You Have Dry Skin, Look for Ingredients Like Hyaluronic Acid</h1>
	
	
	<P style="font-size:120%;width:800px">The good news if you have skin prone to dryness is that it’s perfectly
			suited for a mask. “Face masks represent an amazing tool for augmenting 
			the natural skin barrier and retaining moisture,” says Hollmig. Dry skin is
			more than simply uncomfortable. As the AAD points out, dry skin can
			crack, allowing irritants and germs into skin that can even lead to an
			infection. Masks are occlusive — something that sits on top of skin and<br><br>
			prevents moisture loss. After using one, you’ll likely see that your skin
			“becomes less dry and flaky, and more plump and moist,” he says.
			Hollmig recommends looking for a mask that contains top-notch hydrators
			like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or squalene. For example, ceramides
			have been shown in research to help repair skin’s barrier, noted a study
			published in February 2018 in Pharmaceutical Research. <br><br>Yet watch for
			ingredients like AHAs, which as an exfoliator can cause peeling, so you
			want to observe how your skin reacts when using them, says Hollmig.
			One option is the immensely popular My Skin Mentor Dr. G Aqua Collagen
			Mask, sold by the Korean beauty website Soko Glam. The sheet mask
			hydrates with hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and aloe leaf extract. </p>

	<h1 style="font-size:160%;width:800px">6.If You’re Looking to Reduce Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Look for Silicone</h1>

	
	<P style="font-size:120%;width:800px">Fine lines and wrinkles appear after collagen and elastin, the supportive
			structures within skin, begin to break down, according to Dermstore.com.
			In addition, skin becomes drier, something that exacerbates the look of
			lines. That said, a mask can only do so much when it comes to wrinkles.
			Most of the benefit from masks comes from the fact that they address the
			appearance of lines by hydrating skin, says Waldorf. One sound option,<br><br>
			says Hollmig, is a silicone pad, which plumps up the outer layer of skin to
			help smooth out wrinkles, he explains. (Wrinkles Schminkles Forehead
			Wrinkle Remover Pads are one such product.)
			“Silicone pads absolutely help smooth forehead lines,” Hollmig says.<br><br> Fair
			warning: “I would expect results to be only temporary, just like a topical
			moisturizer,” he says. These do not contain an active ingredient to
			stimulate collagen production, so you’ll see a short-term benefit from the 
			hydration. The benefit is that you can use these in targeted ways, like
			before a night out or important event.</p>

		<h1 style="font-size:160%;width:800px">7. If Your Skin Is Dull and Parched From Traveling, Look for
Antioxidants</h1>
		
			
			<P style="font-size:120%;width:800px">One of the big benefits of a mask is “their ability to naturally moisturize
			the skin by helping the outer layer reduce 'transepidermal water loss,'
			which is the loss of natural moisture when water evaporates from skin,”
			says Hollmig. That’s likely to happen if you’re traveling on an airplane.
			“Traveling is really hard on the skin. Airplane air is super dry, which make
			the skin dull and can even cause cracking and irritation,” he says.<br><br>
			(Forgetting to hydrate by drinking water can also contribute to dullness.)
			And, just like the whole travel process can cause psychological stress and
			zap your sleep, it also physically stresses skin by forcing it to adapt to a
			new environment, Hollmig adds.<br><br>
			In addition to moisturizing, you’ll want to brighten jet-lagged skin
			with antioxidants such as vitamin C. Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask
			combines antioxidant vitamin C to renew radiance and sodium
			hyaluronate (a form of hyaluronic acid) to restore moisture. It’s also
			gentle enough to be applied on the eye area and doesn’t need to be
			washed off (just rub in excess), which is helpful when you’re mid-journey.</p>
